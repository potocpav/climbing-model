      <h1>Climbing Force Simulator</h1>
      <p>Circles represent climber's <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold">hands</span>, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">feet</span>, and the <span style="color: #111; font-weight: bold">center of mass</span>. Try dragging these circles around, and see how the forces required to hold on change. In every position, it is posible to vary the body tension to shift weight more towards climber's hands or feet.</p>

        <h2>Presets</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="javascript:void(0)" id="scene-default"><b>Overhang</b></a>. Try playing with the slider. You can hang entirely from your hands, or you can push some weight through your feet. This decreases the force through your hands, but requires body tension and worsens the force angle. If you bring the center of mass closer to the wall, hand force decreases significantly.</li>
          <li><a href="javascript:void(0)" id="scene-vertical"><b>Hanging on a vertical wall</b></a>. This illustrates how you can either "hang" or "stand" without changing body position: try adjusting the slider. You can save some <i>serious</i> hand strength by trusting your feet.</li>
          <li><a href="javascript:void(0)" id="scene-slab"><b>Climbing a slab</b></a>. Try moving the center of mass. When it is farther from the wall, the force through feet is at a better angle to the rock. The optimum, without falling backwards, is to be balanced on your feet. But it is also possible to reach the optimum in other positions, using body tension to push through your hands at an angle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Information</h2>
        <p>
        Forces are computed by solving the equations for zero net force and torque. In other words, they are the forces required to achieve static position.
      </p><p>
        Force units are in % of body weight. For example, if your body mass is 60kg, then your body weight is ~600N. Force of 50% is then equivalent to 300N. "Body tension" is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque">torque</a> required to keep the "extremities" from changing relative angle, divided by total body length. Unit is, again % of body weight.
